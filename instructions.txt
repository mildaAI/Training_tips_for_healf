We need to create a streamlit app in python, where we can chat with AI model.
The program will use streamlit for the browser interface. 
Integrate the local gemma3:1b model that is installed to computer through Ollama.
Either use the Python Ollama library.
We should be able to keep continuous conversation with selected model. 
After selecting a model, the program will allow you to enter:
User's age (in years)
User inputs: age, known health problems, time for exercise, fitness goal (Lose weight / Gain muscle mass)
Button: "Generate weekly plan"
The program should run fully locally without requiring any API key.
Generate a weekly exercise plan for the user based on the input data using the local model. 

Use documentation in instruction.txt file
